            Hi my names Anthony Ortiz
            I’ve worked in the emergency medicine / first responder field for the past 6 years I’ve decided that I
            wanted to attempt and pursue a different career path so last year I moved from south Florida Broward county to
            central Florida lake county thou it wasn’t easy moving away from friends and family I don’t regret it as this
            step is just the beginning of my journey to starting fresh and working towards being successful in my new
            career path I currently work for the Walt Disney Company as a security officer and love it; I’m hoping to
            continue working for them in my newfound career path thank you


        </p>
