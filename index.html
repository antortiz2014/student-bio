            Hi my names Anthony Ortiz
            Iâ€™ve worked in the Emergency Medicine / First Responder field for the past 6 years; Iâ€™ve decided that I
            wanted to attempt and pursue a different career path, so last year I moved from south Florida Broward County to
            Central Florida Lake County although it was not easy moving away from friends and family, I do not regret it as this
            step is just the beginning of my journey to starting fresh and working towards being successful in my new
            career path.  Currently I work for the Walt Disney Company at Walt Disney World as a security officer and love it; Iâ€™m hoping to
            continue working for them in my newfound career path 
thank you ðŸ˜Š_
   </p>
